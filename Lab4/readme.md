## Conclusion
In this lab i found many difficulties studieng the command prompt. I have my stepmothers computer and it wouldn't let me put my name in lace of hers. I also can now open a file, but i couldn't create a new folder. There goes 6 points. I did the first step and got through the directory. Although i had difficulties i had fun using the pyhton language. My logo was nicely made and i am eager to learn more.
