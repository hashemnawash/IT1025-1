## Executive Summary 
The purpose of this lab is to study the basic components of an operating sytem by commands. We opened a folder using the command prompt and began to further the study of python.
Furthermore, the lab gave us a glimpse at graphic design and the study of variables. The lab concluded with the study of logos in internet programming.
## Python IDLE
Python Shell is a command line tool that starts up the python interpreter, also,in order to write a more complexed python program you need an editor.(google) IDLE, on the other hand, has combined the editor and interpreter, which allow both  to  function unanimously(Google).According to the reading from chapter 1, the interactive shell window will always be the one with the prompt and the file editor will not have the prompt. (Chapter 1).

## Code Examples
### Variable
:"A variable is like a box in the computer’s memory where you can store a single value. If you want to use the result of an evaluated expression later in your program, you can save it inside a variable."(Chapter 1) The reading uses spam, eggs, and bacon to represent generic names for examples in the book. They represent a numerical value an example of a variable is (spam)"It can only be one word.

### Assignment statement:
An assignment statement consists of a variable name an equal sign which is the assignment operator, as well as the value to be stored(Chapter 1).An example is spam=42.
### Function:
A function  displays the string value inside the parentheses on the screen. An example is print(Hello world). (Chapter 1)
### Three data types:
The three data types are integers, floating point numbers, and strings. Integers are numbers such as -2,-1,0,1,2, furthermore, they indicate values that are whole numbers. Numbers with a decimal point are considered floating numbers an example is 3.14. Finally strings are text which help function the python language. An example is (hello world).

## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
A raster is when you enlarge a small picture and it loses its quality because of millions of tiny pixels. When you view a raster image at its original size or smaller, the pixels are invisible—they're just too small to see.(Begining graphic design) Vector graphics are quite different you can make them any size you want and are not made from pixels, but a special form of geometry.
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
lossless images means that all data from the original file is preserved(JOt form) Lossless compression images remove some data from the original file and saves the image with a reduced file size(JOtform). It matters to developers which they use because data can be lost or preserved. Each type of image can loose its quality and regarding what image you want to portray depending if you want to save the file or not regarding size. The file sizes matter to the graphic designer and if he wants to decrease the size of the file, which one matters.
### File Formats
### File Properties

## Conclusion
In this lab i found many difficulties studieng the command prompt. I have my stepmothers computer and it wouldn't let me put my name in lace of hers. I also can now open a file, but i couldn't create a new folder. There goes 6 points. I did the first step and got through the directory. Although i had difficulties i had fun using the pyhton language. My logo was nicely made and i am eager to learn more.
