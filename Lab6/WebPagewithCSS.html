<h1>Sharks </h1>
<p><p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;">sharks have been around for 1000's of years. The great white is a massive shark that can swallow a person whole. There eyes are black as darkness and they are made out of steel. The movie jaws sends shivers down my spine. I hope to teach you more about the great white shark.</p>
