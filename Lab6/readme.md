## Executive Summary 
In this lab we studied the ip adress and its numerical composition. We also studied web design and created our own web site. Furthermore, we studied the web browser and went further with internet programming.

## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
#### IP Address
The ip adress is the internet protocol address. Ip adresses are numbers assigned to network interfaces.As we put words looking for things on line computers translate these words into numbers. Computers send data to the correct location based on numerical evaluation. The difference between ipv4 and ipv6 is ipv4 are written ina string of four numbers between 0 and 255 and is separated by dots.(IP ADDRESSES)  IPv6 are a longer string of numbers and use the hexadecimal system. They can fit more information in fewer digits. Colons also separate the numeration allowing fewer digits to be written.(IP ADDRESSES) 
#### ICANN
ICANN is responsible for coordinating the management of the technical elements of the DNS to ensure universal resolvability so that all users of the Internet can find all valid addresses. ICANN redistributes ip addresses to five locations which than function the internet. ICANN helps control the central repository of IP addresses. iCANN is reponsible for the internet and is subjected to pthe pressure of maintaing ip addresses all ober the world. 

### TCP/IP
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
TCP/IP stands for “Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol”. "It is fundamentally a network protocol that defines the purpose of how data is sent and received through network adapters, hubs, switches, routers through network." (Basics to TCP). It was created by the us department of defense to connect the US's computer systems. It later developed through institutions into the internet. Client server connection is made virtually by the tcp, this program controlls the movement of the internet. Data is sent through this manner and when ip addresses are given it is as if a telephone just called, the tcp connect you and all data is than given through the connection. 
#### ClientTCP/IP/
They work in manner similar to a telephone, in  which the ip number is a telephone call and the extension is the port number. The client dials the ip number and the server listens to the calls. The client can dial any ip address he wants while the server connects him or her. 

#### Layers
They are important because you can change any portion of the protocol stack and have the sdame desired outcome. In the future all new innovations that change the layer regiment, have no effect on the same desired outcome.
#### Application Layer
HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, SMTP

## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
Http stands for hyper text transfer protocol. When you type ina web address you use http to retrieve the web page. Your information is sent in clear text over the public internet. Hackers can retrieve information from the http address.
### Protocols for Secure HTTP
SEcure hypertext protocol. It has a security feature. All transfer is secure because the data is encrypted and impossible to read. The s means you are entering secure web sites and everything is protected. There is also a pad lock symbol through https. The data is scrambelled so hackers csan't read the information. 

## Securing your Web Browser
  
### Reasons to Secure Browser
You should secure your web browser from spyware and hackers. Not securing your web browser can lead to the malfunction of your computer, as well as the theft of personal information. Hackers can destroy your files, and use your computer to attack other computers.
### Risk Explained
A risk is the action of using cookies, which is files placed on your system to store data for specific websites(securing your web browser). If a website uses cookies for authentification then a hacker may be "able to acquire unauthorized access to that site by obtaining the cookie( securing your web browser)." They can follow my aqctivities on line and they can track bank accounts from the data. They can know a lot of personal information and invade privacy.
## Internet Programming
### World Wide Web Consortium
Lee invented the world wide web and created the consortium to connect the world together. Through his invention businesses and social networks would connect. Networking would take a new ohase and through his consortium technology could be passed and studied by the world.  A standard would be web design and its applications. This is defined as building and rendering web pages. The building of them constitutes the building blocks of a standard which encompasses connection between the client and the world.

### HTML5 and CSS
I used html5 to code my web site. I ran my program and made a paragraph with a ropic. HTML5 is used for basic word logic. CSS defines the character of your words. It allows us to color code and change the font size and description. I also had trouble making a border around the paragraph.
### HTML and XML
XML does not do anything except a person runs a program to recieve and send data.XML was designed to carry data. "HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks."(XML INtroduction)XML tags are not predefined like html tags.

## Components of a URL
https=scheme. A typical URL begins with the scheme. "This tells your browser what type of address it is so the browser connects to it correctly."(Internet tips)

 www.amazon.com=domain The name of the web site. Parts of the name are secondary or top level. 
 
 default page,=no file path provided  When you don't click on a domain a default page occurs. 
 
  top level domain name=.edu When you plug in a top level domain a list of conected things pop up. It gives you a list which is similar to what you are looking for.
  
  anchor =specific location on the page  An anchor is made when the anchor tells your browser to scroll to or load a specific part of the page.
  
 parameters=result of page This goes after the domain name. It is a long string of letters and numbers after you click something on the site. 
## Conclusion
In coclusion i found it difficult to upload all the files. My computer does not have much space. I ultimately want to buy a new computer. I did my very best and hope to improve on what i learned from this course. I am eager to learn more  and have become more familliar witht the study of web design and the url.
