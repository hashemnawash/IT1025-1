## Executive Summary 
In this lab we studied the ip adress and its numerical composition. We also studied web programming and created our own web site. Furthermore, we studied the web browser and went further with internet programming.

## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
#### IP Address
The ip adress is the internet protocol address. Ip adresses are numbers assigned to network interfaces.As we put words looking for things on line computers translate these words into numbers. Computers send data to the correct location based on numerical evaluation. The difference between ipv4 and ipv6 is ipv4 are written ina string of four numbers between 0 and 255 and is separated by dots.(IP ADDRESSES)  IPv6 are a longer string of numbers and use the hexadecimal system. They can fit more information in fewer digits. Colons also separate the numeration allowing fewer digits to be written.(IP ADDRESSES) 
#### ICANN
ICANN is responsible for coordinating the management of the technical elements of the DNS to ensure universal resolvability so that all users of the Internet can find all valid addresses. ICANN redistributes ip addresses to five locations which than function the internet. ICANN helps control the central repository of IP addresses. iCANN is reponsible for the internet and is subjected to pthe pressure of maintaing ip addresses all ober the world. 

### TCP/IP
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
TCP/IP stands for “Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol”. "It is fundamentally a network protocol that defines the purpose of how data is sent and received through network adapters, hubs, switches, routers through network." (Basics to TCP). It was created by the us department of defense to connect the US's computer systems. It later developed through institutions into the internet. Client server connection is made virtually by the tcp, this program controlls the movement of the internet. Data is sent through this manner and when ip addresses are given it is as if a telephone just called, the tcp connect you and all data is than given through the connection. 
#### ClientTCP/IP/
They work in manner similar to a telephone, in  which the ip number is a telephone call and the extension is the port number. The client dials the ip number and the server listens to the calls. The client can dial any ip address he wants while the server connects him or her. 

#### Layers
They are important because you can change any portion of the protocol stack and have the sdame desired outcome. 
#### Application Layer
HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, SMTP
