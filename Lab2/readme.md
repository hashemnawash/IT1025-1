## Executive Summary 
The purpose of this lab is to study the science behind the hardrive, and to study components of computers including and their logic including the the logic behind binary. THis all coincides through a connection between data representation which we studied through the reading and digital devices. The lab also introduced us to the ability to make decimal to binary and reverse. 
This will enable us to begin to study coding and decoding. 

## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates 
The difference is latency is measured by the speed of the rotation of the disk and seek time. Seek time is the hard drives speed in fnding the physical location on the disk(PCTechguide). The larger the latency the slower the rotation and seek time(PC techguide). "A driveâ€™s average access time is the duration  between the time a request for data is made by the computer system and the time the data is made from the hard  drive"(PC techguide).Transfer rates are the speed at which the data is transfered to and from the hard disk into the hard drive. 
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives 
Hard drives are slower and can be damaged more easily. The disk must be spinning for the hard drive to work, also the head must be in the correct position to read or write the data(PCtechguide). Ina solid state data is read through word length pieces and stored in memory(PCTECHGUIDE).Solid state hard drives have no latency, "there is no degradation of performance because there is no relationship between retrival speed and spatial locality of the hard drive"(Pctechguide).
#### Random Access Memory 
  More ram makes a computer faster because when the memory is low the data must go back to the hard drive instead of the cpu, creating an extra work load.. When the memory is high the data travels to the cpu more effecientlly.(Ramexplained) THe  computer communicates more efficiently with other parts of the hard drive when the memory is high. For example, when your storage is low on a cell phone, your cell phone can't run fast because the ram must go back to the hard drive not the cpu.(Ramexplained) Dims have 64 bits of memory and can make twice as much data than the 32 bit of data through the clock cycle.(Ram Explained) 64 bit hard drives use dimms while 32 bit hard drives use simms. 64 bits hard drives have more memory than 32 bit hard drives(Ram Explained). Computers only understand 1's and 0's. Ina 64 bit data path has 8 bit wide bus., while a 32 data path has 4 bit wide bus.(Ramexplained)

## Conclusion
 The lab was difficult through the amount of questions and reading. I couldn't name a screen shot through my lab top. I thought about making the conversions on the read me file. I than made them on word and turned them in to the professor. I am more confident than before in the study of computers. This lab was as if i was studying computer engineering. I liked how professor Bornstein explained everyhting slowly. I am eager to learn more and thrive with confidence, along with even more ambition.
