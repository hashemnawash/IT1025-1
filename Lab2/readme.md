## Executive Summary 
The purpose of this lab is to study the science behind the hardrive, and to study components of computers including and their logic including the the logic behind binary. THis all coincides through a connection between data representation which we studied through the reading and digital devices. The lab also introduced us to the ability to make decimal to binary and reverse. 
This will enable us to begin to study coding and decoding. 

## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates 
The difference is latency is measured by the speed of the rotation of the disk and seek time. Seek time is the hard drives speed in fnding the physical location on the disk(PCTechguide). The larger the latency the slower the rotation and seek time(PC techguide). "A driveâ€™s average access time is the duration  between the time a request for data is made by the computer system and the time the data is made from the hard  drive"(PC techguide).Transfer rates are the speed at which the data is transfered to and from the hard disk into the hard drive. 
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives 
Hard drives are slower and can be damaged more easily. The disk must be spinning for the hard drive to work, also the head must be in the correct position to read or write the data(PCtechguide). Ina solid state data is read through word length pieces and stored in memory(PCTECHGUIDE).Solid state hard drives have no latency, "there is no degradation of performance because there is no relationship between retrival speed and spatial locality of the hard drive"(Pctechguide).
