## Executive Summary 
The purpose of this lab is to study the science behind the hardrive, and to study components of computers including and their logic including  the logic behind binary. THis all coincides through a connection between data representation which we studied through the reading and digital devices. The lab also introduced us to the ability to make decimal to binary and reverse. 
This will enable us to begin to study coding and decoding. 

## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates 
The difference is latency is measured by the speed of the rotation of the disk and seek time. Seek time is the hard drives speed in fnding the physical location on the disk(PCTechguide). The larger the latency the slower the rotation and seek time(PC techguide). "A driveâ€™s average access time is the duration  between the time a request for data is made by the computer system and the time the data is made from the hard  drive"(PC techguide).Transfer rates are the speed at which the data is transfered to and from the hard disk into the hard drive. 
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives 
Hard drives are slower and can be damaged more easily. The disk must be spinning for the hard drive to work, also the head must be in the correct position to read or write the data(PCtechguide). Ina solid state data is read through word length pieces and stored in memory(PCTECHGUIDE).Solid state hard drives have no latency, "there is no degradation of performance because there is no relationship between retrival speed and spatial locality of the hard drive"(Pctechguide).
#### Random Access Memory 
  More ram makes a computer faster because when the memory is low the data must go back to the hard drive instead of the cpu, creating an extra work load.. When the memory is high the data travels to the cpu more effecientlly.(Ramexplained) THe  computer communicates more efficiently with other parts of the hard drive when the memory is high. (Ramexplained) Dims have 64 bits of memory and can make twice as much data than the 32 bit of data through the clock cycle.(Ram Explained) 64 bit hard drives use dimms while 32 bit hard drives use simms. 64 bits hard drives have more memory than 32 bit hard drives(Ram Explained). Computers only understand 1's and 0's. Ina 64 bit data path has 8 bit wide bus., while a 32 data path has 4 bit wide bus.(Ramexplained)   

### ALU and the Control Unit
An arithmetic logic units  are digital circuits used to perform   logic operations in the central processing unit.(Wikipedia) The newest CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs.Most of the operations of a CPU are performed by one or more ALUs, which load data from input registers(WIkipedia). A register is a small amount of storage available as part of a CPU. "The control unit tells the ALU what operation to perform on that data and the ALU stores the result in an output register("Wikipedia). "The control unit moves the data between these registers, the ALU, and memory".(Wikipedia)


  
### CPU, Input & Output
### Logic Gates 
The OR gate is when either transistor is on, both than turn on. They turn into a 1. The and gate is when if one of the transistors is not turned on than both turn into 0.A truth table shows the output for every possible input.

### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
The purpose of IEEE is to protect and secure the well being of all its professionals. The code of ethics explains that all scientists, engineers, and physists are protected from copywrite and bribary. This is only some of the protection IEEE gives workers. IEEE made rules which protect society from engineers and gave a foundation of anti corruption.

## Data Representation
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
You can represent the same number in decimal, hexadecimal and binary. Hexadecimal portrays more symbols which lessen the quantity.You can solve more numbers with less value, in hexadecimal.Binary goes with the power of 2, decimal the power of 10, and hexadecimal with the power of 16. Furthermore, 6 letters are used added to the 10 digits to decrease size of numbers.

### Hexadecimal Color Representation
It is the color violet warm. This would be problematic through readability and concentration. The color does not help people connect and understand  the web pages. Black should be used because it coincides with the needs of the web site.

## Conclusion
 The lab was difficult through the amount of questions and reading. I couldn't name a screen shot through my lab top. I thought about making the conversions on the read me file. I than made them on word and turned them in to the professor. I am more confident than before in the study of computers. This lab was as if i was studying computer engineering. I liked how professor Bornstein explained everyhting slowly. I am eager to learn more and thrive with confidence, along with even more ambition.
