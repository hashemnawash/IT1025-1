## Executive Summary 
In this lab we covered the information system component software and its types. At the same time the lab advanced virtualization and its problems. Furthermore, we wrote a program based on the computer language called python. The professor also asked us to study our goals in Information technology. We made a resume and studied the different opportunities the IT field has to offer.

## Software
Utility software allows you to modify or fix your hard drive in some way. (chapter 3) An example is anti malware software. Utility software will let you get rid of programs you don't want installed (chapter 3). Application software allows you to achieve a specific goal on the computer. An example is microsoft excel (chapter 3). Lastly, operating system software give mangement between the hard ware and the interface, as well as between the hardware and the user(chapter 3). An example is video games or word processing. An operating system allows the user to manage the hardware resources on the computer and even write applications(chapter 3).

### Types of Software
### ERP
The enterprise resource planning program allows an entire organization to come under one data base. It was implemented in the 1990's, and can give a return of a good investment. All employees use the erp and the program is utilized under one data base. The erp covers all facets of a business and can purchase modules for specific tasks(chapter 3). An example is Microsoft, or SAP.


## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
A type of IT problem solved by virtualization is operating system virtualization. In this issue bulk hardware costs are reduced, furthermore, it increases security, as well as limits time on software up dates. If an agent needs to use 90 percent of one he can work more efficiently without physically using all of them. Virtualization can help split tasks from three servers into just 2. AS you increase the power of one of the servers virtualization helps use the physical machines full capacity by distributing its capabilities through diffeent users(what is virtualization).

### Role of Hypervisor
The role of hypervisors in virtualization is resources are partitioned from the physical environments to the virtual. When the hypervisor is running and there is an instruction from the user, there is a request made to the physical system and the changes are made ( what is Virtualization).
 
## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
It is a syntax free representation of language(google)."The Python pseudocode must be a very close representation of the algorithmic logic(google)."The pseudo code is not an actual programming language, so it cannot be compiled into an executable program(google).It is an informal language which helps programmers develop alogorithms.

### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
A compiled language in programming is language which is implementation are compilers and not interpreters(google). An interpreted language is implementations execute instructions directly and freely(google). Python is a compiled language.


## Career Exploration
### Handshake
I logged in and created an account I found that there were three jobs in cyber security. The location is in Atlanta Georgia. The job is under IBM. There were also other internships for many different fields. This is what i want to do. I need more schooling, I just got started in Information technology. There were also jobs for engineering. They all seemed overly advanced. I am not yet qualified, but this is a usefull tool to find employment. 
### Bureau of Labor Statistics
I typed IT in the handbook and recieved thousands of answers. The job profiles range from cyber security to web designers. I then typed cyber security and companies want a cyber security consultant. They also want an information security analyst. When I clicked on the cyber security job they will teach specialties. You need a bachelors degree and experience. THey will teach me to retrace hackers, and fix software which is vulnerable. I am really interested. I am not qualified, but onee day i will look for these jobs. I need more schooling.
### Certifications
I researched the cyber security analyst certificate. It is the CYSA+ certificate program. You have to take an exam based on your knowledge of many types cyber security information. The exam consisits of applying behavior analytics to networks and devices to prevent cyber security threats. Leveagin techniques and analyzing data is part of the exam.
### Certificates and Degrees
I am intersted in the cyber security certificate. By 2026 the rate of growth for demand is 29 percent. There is a cyber security associate degree. I just got started so this is a realistic goal. The job market is in high demand. There is also a cyber security post degree certificate. I am going to research more and learn the basics. I plan to study the exam and this could take up to 3 years.
### Co-ops / Internships
The student participates in the coop orientation rocess. Then you upload your resume on handshake. Moving along, the student then the student works with an employment specialist, and finally the student signs a cooperative education agreement form. Coop gives you hands on experience and gives you confidence in working and applying your skills to the desired profession. It helps build your resume and gives employers a sign of content in regards to the employee so they can trust them in working with their company.



### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
There is a cyber security club a tthe west campust. Professor Lyons operates the club. It would be beneficial to join this club so as to improve my esume and give me experience in the field. It will also improve my basic confidence and give me a backround and foundation to begin to research and study cyber security.
The ccdc mission is to give institutions with  assurance or computer security, a controlled, competitive environment to assess their student's understanding and operational competency in managing the challenges, which are current, in protecting a corporate network infrastructure.(CCDC from the web site)

## Conclusion
As I completed this lab I had difficulties writing the program in Python. As I completed the program I felt a sense of relief. I hesitantly procrastinated in completing the lab.I also had problems with my lab top. I hope to achieve my ambitions in cyber security. I studied different roles IT professionals can under take.  I hope I can join the cyber security club and advance my resume and career.
