## Executive Summary
This is an example, please delete and create your own professional summary:
The purpose of Lab 1 is to explore the IT1025 course set-up, examine the history of computing and get up and running with GitHub. IT1025 covers a wide-range of computing topics with a primary goal of assisting in determining student passions in IT.  IT history has many interesting facets. One of particular interest was... Regardless of one's passion in IT, frameworks such as GitHub are useful to create, update and maintain any type of file and work in an organized repository.
The purpose of this lab is to explore information systems and their components. The reading showed examples of them as well. The reading also showed cloud computing and information on github. We learned how to use github through the directions of the professor. We aslo learned how to take a screen shot and save a file on zip. I answered the three questions and followed through with citations. The reading also over viewed Jeff Bazos and IBM. THere were key examples from our everyday lives which help us better understand the study of information technology. 

## Information System Components
The five components are hardware, software, data, people, and process(Chapter 1). An example of hardware is the disk or the computer keyboard. An example of software derives from two main categories, operating systems and application software. An example is microsoft windows. An example of data is your social networking acoount. Another example is your phone number. An example of people is developers, another exampe is system analysts. Finally, an example of process is "business process management," which gives the ability to improve procedures in a business (Chaper 1).

## GitHub
### Client - Server Architecture
### Cloud Computing
Client server architecture is the ability to connect your PC, (The Client), to a main computer,(The server), the server than gives certain abilities to each client based on what he or she can or cannot do(Chapter 1). Github is an example of client server architecture because the client, the student, makes reports, and is than connected to the main server, Github, which than gives information to anyone the student wants to share it with. The server, main frame, connects to everyone wanting to know the information. git hub gives abilities to each client which than connects information to all wanting to see. This form of client server architevture is networking. 

## Conclusion

Through the course of this lab I learned about the course requirements for IT1025 as well as an overview of client-server architecture and GitHub.  I found GitHub to be interesting but initially had difficulty creating a respoitory.  I revisited the process but was still stumped so I contacted my instructor and with a few pointers was then able to complete the process successfully. I look forward to spending more time on GitHub and eventually learning about database which I believe is my current IT passion.
A cloud computing is the abilty to communicate and store data witout knowing where the information is coming from(wikipedia). For eample it is as if elecricity is sent to users and they don't need to worry about hwere it comes from(Wikipedia). An example of cloud computing is the internet on a mobile device. Another example is twitter on a cell phone.  Cloud computing makes way for "applications to be part of the communications channel rather than a repository of programs and information(Chapter 1)."

## Conclusion
 I found github difficult to use because of my lack of experience on the program. I contacted one of my peers and he helped me greatly. I aslo figured out that there is no quiz 1.
 As I continue on in 1025, i will learn more. I am eager to begin the stuudy of hardware in the next lesson. I hope to improve my wriiting and begin to go in depth on the study of informtion technology.
