## Executive Summary 


## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
Data are raw facts that may have intent. It can be qualitative or quantitative.  data can be a result of a measurement or calculation. It can also be descriptive. Information is processed data that has total purpose and relevance.(Data and data bases) For example, monthly sales from the past year is information. Knowledge is human perception or beliefs relating to a certain area according to a relationship of data. For example a conceived relationship between quality of goods and sales would be knowledge.(Data and data bases)
### Relational Data
#### Primary Key:
The primary key would be the order id and customer id. This is teh only way to differentiate and keep track of all orders and customers. 
#### Relationship between customers and orders:
 The two different id's which are order and customer are listed on each piece of field. Connecting them would be by showing each table has both pieces of information. When one sees one id they see the information and connect them together. Both tables have similar information on them. Thet are connected through data. 
#### Foreign key of orders table:
The foreign key of the orders table would be the orders id. This would connect both tables and retrieve data information.


### Field Data Types
There are two main reasons that  define the data type of a field.(DAta and data bases) First, a data type tells the database what functions can be taken with the performance of the data. "For example, if we  perform mathematical functions with one of the fields, we must be sure to tell the database that the field is a number data type"(Data and data bases).The second important reason to define data type is so that the proper amount of storage space is allocated for our data."(Data and data bases)

### Big Data
#### Four "V"s of Big Data
Volume is important and refers to the size of the data.Variety refers to heterogeneous sources and the nature of data.Velocity refers to the sppeed at which data is generated. Finally variability refers to the inconsistency at which data can be applied.It makes it difficult to handle and manage data efferctively. 
#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data
Technology such as search engines and social media web sites have driven the need for big data. Terabytes are generated in a day from facebook and search engines. Big data must process tons of information. 

## Structured Query Language (SQL) 
### RDBMS and SQL
### Relationship, Primary and Foreign Keys

## SQL Injections

## Ethical and Legal Implications
### Code of Ethics
### Intellectual Property
### Information Collection

## Conclusion
I learned a lot from this lab, primarily the sql language. I hope to improve my python skills in the future. ON break i will begin to look more into python and computer language. I also enjoyed learning the subject of intellectual property. Computers and there science have their own legal implications. ..
