## Executive Summary 
The purpose of this lab was to study the sql data base language. WE also studied data, which accompanied the discussion of Big data. 


## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
Data are raw facts that may have intent. It can be qualitative or quantitative.  data can be a result of a measurement or calculation. It can also be descriptive. Information is processed data that has total purpose and relevance.(Data and data bases) For example, monthly sales from the past year is information. Knowledge is human perception or beliefs relating to a certain area according to a relationship of data. For example a conceived relationship between quality of goods and sales would be knowledge.(Data and data bases)
### Relational Data
#### Primary Key:
The primary key would be the order id and customer id. This is teh only way to differentiate and keep track of all orders and customers. 
#### Relationship between customers and orders:
 The two different id's which are order and customer are listed on each piece of field. Connecting them would be by showing each table has both pieces of information. When one sees one id they see the information and connect them together. Both tables have similar information on them. Thet are connected through data. 
#### Foreign key of orders table:
The foreign key of the orders table would be the orders id. This would connect both tables and retrieve data information.


### Field Data Types
There are two main reasons that  define the data type of a field.(DAta and data bases) First, a data type tells the database what functions can be taken with the performance of the data. "For example, if we  perform mathematical functions with one of the fields, we must be sure to tell the database that the field is a number data type"(Data and data bases).The second important reason to define data type is so that the proper amount of storage space is allocated for our data."(Data and data bases)

### Big Data
#### Four "V"s of Big Data
Volume is important and refers to the size of the data.Variety refers to heterogeneous sources and the nature of data.Velocity refers to the sppeed at which data is generated. Finally variability refers to the inconsistency at which data can be applied.It makes it difficult to handle and manage data efferctively. 
#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data
Technology such as search engines and social media web sites have driven the need for big data. Terabytes are generated in a day from facebook and search engines. Big data must process tons of information. 

## Structured Query Language (SQL) 
### RDBMS and SQL
RDMBS stands for relational data base management system.The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects and they are called  tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.(SQL introduction) Each table is divided up into smaller entities called fields. The field in the customers table example are  CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country. A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table.(sql introduction) SQL lets you manipulate data bases. RDMBS run under the sql and make up the data which derives from the sql language. 
### Relationship, Primary and Foreign Keys


## SQL Injections
SQL injections are a code injection technique. It destroys your data base. SQL injection always occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, the user gives you an SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database.(SQL injection) To defend agaisnt sql injections you may use sql parameters. SQL parameters are values that are added to an SQL query at execution time, in a controlled manner.(SQL injection)

## Ethical and Legal Implications
### Code of Ethics
"A code of ethics is a document that outlines a set of acceptable behaviors for a professional or social group." (chapter 12)One of the major advantages of creating a code of ethics by the acm is that it clarifies the acceptable standards of behavior for a professional group.(CHapter12) The varied backgrounds and experiences of the members of a group lead to a variety of ideas regarding what is acceptable behavior. While to many the guidelines may seem obvious, having these items detailed provides clarity and consistency. (Chapter 12)
### Intellectual Property
If the svg was used as a good or service it would need to be trademarked. As long as an organization uses its trademark and defends it against infringement, the protection afforded by it does not expire.(Chapter 12) It is important to copywrite the svg model to protect our patent.No one may use the same logo not to steal my idea or take away my own unique perspective. My logo has its own copywrite which details no one may use the same. My idea makes me money and no one cans steal the profit from my logo. 
### Information Collection
Through digital technologies adolescents have the right to keep their information private. Through health care individuals have the right to keep their information disclosed. ON line, people will never get information based on these organizations because they protect the privacy of its own users whos information is case sensetive. 
## Conclusion
I learned a lot from this lab, primarily the sql language. I hope to improve my python skills in the future. ON break i will begin to look more into python and computer language. I also enjoyed learning the subject of intellectual property. Computers and there science have their own legal implications. ..
