## Executive Summary 


## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
Data are raw facts that may have intent. It can be qualitative or quantitative.  data can be a result of a measurement or calculation. It can also be descriptive. Information is processed data that has total purpose and relevance.(Data and data bases) For example, monthly sales from the past year is information. Knowledge is human perception or beliefs relating to a certain area according to a relationship of data. For example a conceived relationship between quality of goods and sales would be knowledge.(Data and data bases)
### Relational Data
#### Primary Key:
The primary key would be the order id and customer id. This is teh only way to differentiate and keep track of all orders and customers. 
#### Relationship between customers and orders:
 The two different id's which are order and customer are listed on each piece of field. Connecting them would be by showing each table has both pieces of information. When one sees one id they see the information and connect them together. Both tables have similar information on them. Thet are connected through data. 
#### Foreign key of orders table:
The foreign key of the orders table would be the orders id. This would connect both tables and retrieve data information.


### Field Data Types
There are two important reasons that we must properly define the data type of a field.(DAta and data bases) First, a data type tells the database what functions can be performed with the data. For example, if we wish to perform mathematical functions with one of the fields, we must be sure to tell the database that the field is a number data type.The second important reason to define data type is so that the proper amount of storage space is allocated for our data.(Data and data bases)
