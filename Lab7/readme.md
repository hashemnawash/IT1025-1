## Executive Summary 
In this lab we studied file compression using a zip file. We than moved forward through the language of shark in python. As we went along we answered questions based on the reading. 


## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
The purpose of file compression is to make the file size smaller. Instead of sending each file individually, you can send them all under one file.It also takes less time toupload as you under go file compression.

### Compression and File Size
The file size of a compressed svg file is smaleer than hat of a jpeg. Jpegs take up more space while the properties of a svg file are compressed and limited. Using the compressed zip helped us limit the size and sructure of the properties. The type of graphic is also not similar, the svg graphic uses a lossy compression, whikle the jpeg uses a losly compression. 


## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
### Attributes:
The attributes of shark language is that it pertains to a class and an object. It is an object oriented study. The attributes would be swim and be awesome.
### Methods 
Methods are a special kind of function that are defined within a class."(Object oriented programming)


### Constructor:
"The constructor method is used to initialize data. It has to run as soon as one object of a class is instantiated."(object oriented programming) 
 The constructor method is always initialized. You should use this method to carry out any initializing you would like to do with your class objects.(Object oriented Programming)
### Class vs. Object
Classes are usually a blue print you can define to create objects. An object is an instance of a class. The process of creating an object from the class 'blueprint' is called instantiation. In actuality, you instantiate an instance of the class ,by than giving it a name,  than you will refer to it when  calling methods.(Google).

## Object Oriented Concepts
### Instantiated Objects
It is used to initialize data and put it in words based on a derived class. The instantiated objects of the shark class are your name, your age, and the color of your hair.

### Inheritance
Inheritance is when classes have children and one class can be created based on the original class. The original is known as the base class. The derived class inherits all atributes of the base class. An example of the shark class is (Sammy).
### Encapsulation and Abstraction

Program code reuse has been a part of structured systems development and programming languages (such as COBOL) for many years, and there have been subprograms that encapsulate data. (object oriented Concepts) This relates to the shark class by reusing coding and developing similar which are derived from the base class.
## Unified Modeling Language (UML)

## Conclusion
In conclusion I had to make another lucid chart, which was fun. I am begining to study the language of python. Learning the shark class was also amusing. I hope to learn more and aquire more as well.
