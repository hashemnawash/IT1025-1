## Executive Summary 
In this lab we studied file compression using a zip file. We than moved forward through the language of shark in python. As we went along we answered questions based on the reading. 


## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
The purpose of file compression is to make the file size smaller. Instead of sending each file individually, you can send them all under one file.It also takes less time toupload as you under go file compression.

### Compression and File Size
The file size of a compressed svg file is smaleer than hat of a jpeg. Jpegs take up more space while the properties of a svg file are compressed and limited. Using the compressed zip helped us limit the size and sructure of the properties. The type of graphic is also not similar, the svg graphic uses a lossy compression, whikle the jpeg uses a losly compression. 


## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
### Attributes:
The attributes of shark language is that it pertains to a class and an object. It is an object oriented study.
### Methods 
Methods are a special kind of function that are defined within a class


### Constructor:
### Class vs. Object

## Object Oriented Concepts
### Instantiated Objects
### Inheritance
### Encapsulation and Abstraction

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)

## Conclusion
In conclusion I had to make another lucid chart, which was fun. I am begining to study the language of python. Learning the shark class was also amusing. I hope to learn more and aquire more as well.
