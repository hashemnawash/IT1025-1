## Executive Summary 
In this lab we studied the science of anlytics and logic through the use of the lucid chart. We then went through networking and defined key concepts. Furthermore , we concluded the lab with the study of cyber security. There are threats to our national interest. We studied ways you can fix problems in networking along with different issues such as the common sense behind the homeland security defense against hackers.
## Lucidchart
My experiene using the lucid chart was profoundly interesting. I was tutored on the subject and we got through it very quickly. The common sence of programming and the process of creating the chart was easy. I liked how we can program a number to type big or small. It was very fascinating.

## Introduction to Networking

### Data Transmission
#### Packet: a packet is a fundamental unit of data over the internet.It relates to the definition by allowing data to go into tiny pieces and it takes time to collect them all together to show you a video or a picture. 

#### Packet-Switching:
Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address This relates to the key word by showing that tiny pieces of data go in thier own routes trying to find the address in optimal time. 

#### IP Address:
unique identifieng number. This definition relates because an ip adress is assigned a unique identifying number.

#### DNS:
Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com. This relates to the definition by showing DNS stands for a “domain name server or system.” DNS acts as the directory of websites on the Internet. When a request to access a host with a domain name is given, a DNS server is queried. It returns the IP address of the host requested, allowing for proper routing." (Chapter 5)

#### Protocol:Allowed different devices to communicate under a set of rules. The definition is related to the key term because different companies with the same set of rules can communicate creating the internet. 

### Networking Hardware
#### Switch vs. Hub
A hub only knows when its devices are connected to other ports. Accepts internet connection from other devices. All the divices see the same data packet. Than shows to other hubs. Unnneccesay trafic which wastes bandwidth. A switch accepts multiple ports. A switch is intelligent. It knows the physical addresses and stores them. Can send to a single desstination port.  It delivers to any computer it wants. Switches are preferred they reduce unneccessary trafic.
#### Router vs. Switch and Hub
Exchanges and routes data all over the internet. Routers read ip addresses. Routers forward datta from one network to another using the IP adress.  Routing determines if ip adress needs to go through a network. Accepts data packets which are only inteneded for certain computers. SWitch and hub can't connect to the internet they do not use ip addresses. Switches keep the mac adresses.  The hub and switch cannot epand dat drom different locations in the world. Intended data is given through routers to anyone intended unlike the hubs and switches. 
### Network Topologies
#### Single point of Failure
Wire topologies such as the star topology can go through a single point of failure. When the switch or hub fails all computers on the central point would be effected taking down the entire network. All  the computers are connected to a hub or switch in the star topology. When a computer fails all the other are still not effected.
#### Infrastrucutre vs. Wireless Mesh
In the infrastructure topology you can connect the switch to a wireless access point. It can connect computers and lab tops. IN a wireless mesh all devices are wirelessly interconnected.  AS you ask for internet connection the signal goes through multiple devices just to get to the switch. I believe the infrastructure topology would be best because it is easy access from a switch to the connection of a lab top. It is very efficient for the home use. While wireless mesh is great for businesses. 
### Network Design
I created a link between two computers and 2 routers. They connect to the internet and have legitimacy by connecting all together. This diagram i made shows the ability for the internet to connect through multiple devices.

### NSA/CSS

The NSA Cybersecurity program prevents and eradicates threats to U.S. national security systems and focuses on the Defense Industrial Base and the development of U.S. weapons’. It also strives to promote cybersecurity education, research, and career-building."(NSA)
## Cybersecurity and Encryption

### Information Systems Security

#### Security Triad
#### Authentication
#### ACL and RBAC
#### Ciphertext, Public Key and Private Key
#### Public Key Cryptography

### Cryptography
#### Encryption
#### Frequency Fingerprint
#### Polyalphabetic Cipher
#### Polyalphabetic Example

#### Brute-Force

## Conclusion
During this lab i figured out how to attain through logical reasoning a lucid chart. I also created a framework of a connector in a certain infrastructure. Cyber security seemed interesting and i hope to further learn more in cyber security club. Learning networking was also fun and i hope to achieve a degree to perform this task through employment. I really want to achieve through percision and the power of the human spirit.
